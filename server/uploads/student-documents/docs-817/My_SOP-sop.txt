HOOK
javad janjani increasingly driven by data and AI, my curiosity has always been how technology can truly augment human decisions. That curiosity pushed me toward ML and NLP.

SEGUE (JOURNEY / MOTIVATION)
This passion led me to pursue rigorous training in computer science, exploring both theory and real-world applications of intelligent systems.

ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS
• GPA 3.8; Dean’s List ×6
• 2 peer-reviewed publications
• Led a 5-member team; 94% NLP accuracy (↑12%)
• Outstanding CS Student Award (Senior year)

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
200+ hours teaching programming to underrepresented youth; President of AI Ethics Society; organized symposiums with 300+ attendees.

PUBLICATIONS
Doe, J. & Smith, A. (2023). "Advancing NLU via Contextual Embeddings" – ICML.
Smith, A., Doe, J. (2023). "Ethics of LLM Deployment" – Journal of AI Ethics.

PROBLEMS IN BACKGROUND
During an internship, our early bias-detection approach kept failing. Studying fairness metrics and collaborating with social scientists led to the breakthrough used in my thesis.

WHY THIS SCHOOL?
Stanford’s HAI and the Stanford NLP Group match my focus on interpretable ML. I’m especially keen to work with Prof. Chen on neural interpretability.

YOUR GOAL / CONCLUSION
Short-term: contribute to explainable-AI research and co-author papers.
Long-term: lead a lab building transparent, fair AI adopted by industry.
Conclusion: this program is the right environment to realize these goals.
